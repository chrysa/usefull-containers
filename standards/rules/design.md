## Design system

Every human-facing surface is built from a shared design system — no ad-hoc style values in
components. This complements *dark mode + WCAG 2.1 AA* and the `ui-ux` skill.

- **Design tokens are the single source of style** — colours, typography, spacing, radii,
  shadows, z-index live as tokens (JSON/CSS vars) consumed by code. **No** hardcoded style
  literals in components (mirrors *no hardcoded constants*).
- **Versioned brand kit** — primary/secondary/semantic palette, **≤ 2 type families**, logo
  (variants + clear space), one icon set. Defined and versioned, not per-repo reinvented.
- **Living component library** — reusable components with documented states and variants
  (Storybook or equivalent); one canonical implementation per component.
- **Systematic spacing scale & grid** — spacing on a fixed scale (4/8 px base), shared grid
  and breakpoints; no arbitrary margins.
- **Defined type hierarchy** — explicit type scale (size, weight, line-height, tracking) with
  named roles (`display/title/body/caption`), never ad-hoc sizes.
- **Systematic interaction states & feedback** — every interactive element exposes
  hover/focus/active/disabled; every action gives visible feedback (< 100 ms); visible keyboard
  focus is mandatory.
- **Consistent UX writing** — voice-and-tone guide; error messages say what to do (no raw
  codes); action-oriented labels and CTAs; terminology aligned to the domain glossary.
- **Standardised motion** — tokenised durations and easing (e.g. 150/250 ms); animation is
  functional (state transition, feedback), never gratuitous; honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Mobile-first responsive** — mobile-first design, breakpoints from tokens, touch targets
  **≥ 44 px**, no fixed widths.
- **Design ↔ dev handoff contract** — design ships exported tokens, component specs (measures,
  states, behaviours) and edge cases; dev consumes the tokens, never redefines the values.
