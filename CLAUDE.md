# CLAUDE.md — usefull-containers

## Project

**Name:** usefull-containers
**Stack:** Mixed / to document
**Purpose:** [![CI — Analyse](https://github.com/chrysa/usefull-containers/actions/workflows/analyse.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrysa/usefull-containers/actions/workflows/analyse.yml).

## Working Rules

- Language: English — all code, comments, documentation, instructions, and configuration files must be in English.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`type(scope): description`).
- Prefer repository make targets when a Makefile is available.
- Read `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` when present before starting task-specific work.

## Claude Compatibility

- Claude Code hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`.
- Shared hooks, thresholds and skills are vendored from `chrysa/shared-standards` into this repository.
- Keep repository-specific overrides in this file and keep generic automation in `.claude/`.

## Read Order

1. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (private user preferences)
2. `CLAUDE.md` (this repository)
3. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` when present

## Available Skills

Local Claude skills in `.claude/skills/`:
- `testing-pytest` for Python test work
- `dockerfile-multistage` for Dockerfile authoring
- `api-design` for REST and FastAPI/API design tasks

## Repository Notes

- Add repository-specific architecture, operational constraints, or domain rules here when needed.
- If this repository needs extra Claude skills, add them under `.claude/skills/`.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **usefull-containers** (145 symbols, 118 relationships, 0 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

# chrysa — Transverse Standards

These conventions are identical across every chrysa repo. Repo-specific rules live in the
local `CLAUDE.md`; this file is the shared baseline imported by it.

## Normative annexes

This file is the **only** artifact inlined into consumer repos. The annexes below are
**equally normative** — they detail rules stated here in short form. They are not inlined;
read them at
`https://github.com/chrysa/shared-standards/blob/main/standards/annexes/`.
Where an annexe and this file disagree, **this file wins**.

| Annexe                    | Scope                                                          |

| `ARCHITECTURE-DDD.md`     | project profiles · DDD levels · layers & aggregates · Python & C#/.NET structure |
| `AGENTIC-CAPABILITIES.md` | agent actions: manifests, risk R0–R5, sandboxing, audit trail   |

| `GOVERNANCE.md`           | rule identity, maturity ladder, enforcement rollout, sources of truth |

**Source of truth:** the canon lives in this repo. Notion is a governance and decision view
of the standards corpus, not its authority (`GOVERNANCE.md` GV-000). `chrysa/standards` is
deprecated and archived — nothing is added to it, nothing reads from it.

## Non-negotiable conventions

- **Language**: English — all code, comments, docs, instructions, and config files.
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`).
- **Branches**: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/`, `release/` · default branch `develop`.
- **Merge**: squash merge only · force push forbidden · auto-merge requires CI + owner.
- **One PR per issue**, scoped tight. Every PR references an issue (`Closes/Fixes/Refs #N`).
  Exception: label `hotfix`. The `enforce-issue-link` workflow is a blocking status check.
- **Repo provenance — every code repo depends on `project-init`.** A repository is
  **created by** the `project-init` / `chrysa-init` CLI (shared-standards) at birth **and
  kept in sync** with it thereafter: the scaffolded socle (Makefile contract, docs skeleton,
  this standards block, shared skills, CI templates) is re-applied by `distribute-standards.sh`,
  never hand-diverged. The socle is modulated by the `repos.yml` `runtime:` tier (application
  → full socle; `exempt:lib` / `exempt:native` → the relevant subset; pure `exempt:config` →
  standards block only, no application scaffold), but no code repo opts out. A repo that is
  neither scaffolded by nor kept in sync with `project-init` is a defect, not a variant.
- **Tests: pytest only** — assert-style test functions and `pytest-mock` (`mocker`
  fixture: `mocker.patch`, `mocker.AsyncMock`) for all mocking. The stdlib **`unittest`
  framework (`unittest.TestCase`) and `unittest.mock` imports are forbidden** — no
  `import unittest`, no `from unittest.mock import …`. See the `testing-pytest` skill.
- **Frontend tests: Vitest + Testing Library + MSW — from the scaffold, not later.** The
  *pytest only* rule governs Python; it never exempted the frontend from having tests.
  Network is mocked at transport level (MSW/fakes), behaviour is asserted through the
  accessible tree, and every fixed bug ships a regression test. E2E (Playwright) covers
  critical journeys only; **its gate status is declared per repo** in the local `CLAUDE.md` —
  fleet default is non-blocking. Detail: annexe `FRONTEND.md` §4, `TESTING.md`.
- **TypeScript is strict by contract.** `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`, `noImplicitReturns`,
  `useUnknownInCatchVariables`, `isolatedModules` are **all** enabled (plus
  `verbatimModuleSyntax` where the toolchain allows). No implicit `any`; `unknown` at
  boundaries; external data validated at **runtime** even when typed; contract types
  generated from OpenAPI/AsyncAPI, never hand-copied. One committed lockfile, frozen CI
  installs, no `latest` dependency. Detail: annexe `FRONTEND.md` §1.
- **React is a presentation layer, not the domain.** `domain/` and `application/` never
  import React; no `fetch`, browser storage, or vendor SDK in `domain/`. Components and hooks
  stay pure, props/state immutable, derived state computed rather than duplicated;
  `useEffect` synchronises with an external system and does not orchestrate business logic;
  `StrictMode` on for new apps. One API client singleton behind a service layer, one cache
  library for all server state, a root error boundary, and an explicit loading/error/empty
  triad per container. Anything outside the first meaningful paint loads lazily (split routes,
  `loading="lazy"` media, on-demand heavy components) behind a **shape-accurate placeholder**
  that reserves the final dimensions — a skeleton, not a spinner, so arrival shifts no layout.
  Detail: annexe `FRONTEND.md` §2–§3, §7.
- **Every repo declares its profile and DDD level** (`project_profile`, `ddd_level`,
  `bounded_context`, `standards_version`) — architecture is proportionate to business
  complexity, and small tools are not over-architected. Detail: annexe `ARCHITECTURE-DDD.md`.
- **Dark mode** mandatory from V1. **Accessibility** WCAG 2.1 AA — Lighthouse a11y score **≥ 90**,
  full keyboard navigation (Tab/Esc/visible focus), contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (3:1 large text), screen-reader
  tested on critical flows (signup, login, checkout).
- **UI state survives reload & focus** — human-facing surfaces persist their navigation
  and view state (active tab/section, selected sub-view, active context/filters) so a
  **manual reload keeps the current page** — the user lands exactly where they were, never
  reset to a default. Persist to `localStorage` (or the URL for shareable state), guarded
  by a validator that discards stale/removed values. Interface or state changes must
  **propagate across the app's own tabs/windows and on refocus/reload**: listen to the
  browser `storage` event and re-read on `window` `focus`, so a view opened while hidden
  never shows stale state after the user comes back. A reload that loses the user's place,
  or a change that fails to propagate on focus/reload, is a bug.
- **Notion logging**: every advancement and modification (progress, decisions, state
  changes) is logged in Notion — the single source of truth **for project state**. Run
  `@notion-sync` after any state change; on conflict about project state, Notion wins.
  This does **not** apply to the standards corpus: there the repo is the canon and Notion is
  a governance view (annexe `GOVERNANCE.md` GV-000).
- **Agent actions are governed.** Any feature where an agent *acts* (writes, calls, runs,
  changes state) needs a versioned manifest with typed I/O and a business owner, least
  privilege, a declared risk level R0–R5 with proportionate confirmation and dry-run,
  and a documented idempotency/timeout/limits/circuit-breaker/rollback envelope. Untrusted
  execution is sandboxed with network off by default; no agent auto-merges to `main`.
  Detail: annexe `AGENTIC-CAPABILITIES.md`.
- **Projects talk through versioned contracts only.** No import from a sibling repo, no path
  dependency, no submodule used as a runtime link, no access to another project's database or
  private models. Each consumer wraps the external contract in a local adapter and degrades
  cleanly when the provider is gone. Detail: annexe `PROJECT-DECOUPLING.md`.
- **Identity goes through the cluster SSO first.** Every interactive product deployed in the
  cluster integrates the **common cluster SSO** as its primary sign-in. The priority protocol is
  **OpenID Connect over OAuth 2.x** (SAML only where an enterprise context requires it), and the
  connection hierarchy is fixed: **1. cluster SSO → 2. external OAuth provider → 3. local
  account**. A local account is a fallback, never the default; where present it uses a modern
  password hash (argon2/bcrypt) and MFA is enforceable through the SSO. This does **not** break
  *projects talk through versioned contracts only* or *portable data*: identity sits behind an
  adapter, so the product stays independently deployable against an alternative identity provider
  (or a standalone local mode) by configuration, without touching the domain.
- **No hardcoded constants** in code — neither backend (Python) nor frontend (TS).
  All constants and config values (thresholds, business rules, labels, URLs, magic
  numbers) live in **external YAML files** and are loaded at runtime. Code reads them
  through a typed loader (Pydantic Settings backend · generated typed module frontend),
  never as inline literals. Only language-level enums (e.g. `status.HTTP_*`) are exempt.
- **Semantic URLs & code** — URLs are resource-oriented and human-readable: lowercase,
  hyphenated, plural-noun collections, no verbs or actions in the path (`GET /invoices/42`,
  never `/getInvoice?id=42`); REST shapes follow the `api-design` skill. Code is
  self-describing: intention-revealing names over comments, semantic HTML elements
  (`<nav>`, `<button>`, `<main>`, `<header>`…) never a `<div>` wired as a control, and
  ARIA used only to fill gaps native semantics cannot express.
- **URL-addressable frontend navigation — mandatory.** Every navigable view/route/tab/
  detail is a **real, semantic URL** (`/projects/42/settings`, not `/#` or a modal with no
  address). Navigating **must change the URL** via the router (History API `pushState`), so:
  1. the change is **recorded in browser history** — Back/Forward move between views, never
     trap or reload the app;
  2. a link is **right-clickable / middle-clickable / ⌘-clickable → open in a new tab**, which
     means it is a genuine `<a href>` (or the router's `<Link>`), **never** a `<div>`/`<button>`
     with an `onClick` that only mutates state;
  3. the URL is **deep-linkable & shareable** — pasting it in a fresh tab lands on the exact
     same view (route params + query for filters/selection/pagination), reproducible without
     prior in-app state.
  Ephemeral UI (transient toasts, open/closed of a purely local menu) may stay stateless, but
  anything a user would bookmark, share, or reload into is a route. This complements
  *UI state survives reload & focus*: persisted view-state that has an addressable identity
  belongs in the URL, not only `localStorage`.
- **Python packaging — `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth.** `setup.py` and
  `setup.cfg` are **forbidden** for Python packaging (`setup.cfg` allowed only for non-Python
  tooling, e.g. uwsgi). Build backend is **`setuptools`** (never `hatchling`). All tool config
  (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `coverage`) lives in `[tool.*]` — external `ruff.toml`, `mypy.ini`,
  `pytest.ini` are forbidden. Distributed libraries use a `src/` layout and follow the Public API
  Contract (`docs/PUBLIC-API-CONTRACT.md`): sorted `__all__`, relative imports in `__init__`,
  `__version__` via `importlib.metadata`, uniform `install()` entrypoint, shared types in `chrysa-lib`.
- **No virtualenv in a repo — ever.** `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/` are **forbidden** inside a
  project tree. Python runs in the Docker image (deps baked into the image layer, or a named
  volume for editable installs). A committed or on-disk virtualenv is a bug, not a setup step.
  The only sanctioned local Python is a **uv/pipx tool env stored outside the repo** (e.g.
  `~/.local`, `$UV_CACHE_DIR`), never a folder living next to the source.
- **Tool caches & deps never touch the project tree.** `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`,
  `.ruff_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.benchmarks`, `node_modules`, and pip/npm/uv download caches
  are regenerable machine artifacts — they must be **invisible in the repo working copy**.
  Enforcement is three-layered and all three are mandatory:
  1. **`.gitignore`** carries the managed canonical block (`templates/gitignore.canonical`) so
     they are never tracked. Appended, not hand-maintained.
  2. **Docker caches live in named volumes**, and every cache-dir env var points **outside**
     the bind mount so nothing is written back into the mounted source:
     ```yaml
     # docker-compose: a container that bind-mounts the repo
     services:
       tests:
         user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"   # host UID — NEVER `user: root`
         environment:
           PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX: /caches/pycache
           RUFF_CACHE_DIR: /caches/ruff
           MYPY_CACHE_DIR: /caches/mypy
           PYTEST_ADDOPTS: -p no:cacheprovider  # or PYTEST_CACHE_DIR under /caches
           npm_config_cache: /caches/npm
         volumes:
           - .:/code
           - tool-caches:/caches          # named volume, persists across runs
           - node-modules:/code/node_modules   # deps in a volume, shadowing the mount
     volumes:
       tool-caches:
       node-modules:
     ```
  3. **Any container that bind-mounts a repo runs as the host UID** (`user: "${UID}:${GID}"`),
     **never `user: root`** — root-owned artifacts written into a bind mount are unremovable
     without `sudo` and are treated as a defect. Root user is allowed only for containers with
     **no** repo bind mount (e.g. `.:/code` absent).
  Regenerable artifacts already in a repo are purged with `scripts/purge-artifacts.sh`.
- **Every tracked file and folder must earn its place — a repo holds only what is useful to it
  now.** A repository contains its own source, its tests, config that is actually loaded, docs
  that are current, and the templates it distributes — nothing else. Forbidden in the working
  tree and in git:
  1. **Superseded or archived documents** whose useful content has been folded elsewhere. Git
     history *is* the archive — a file that "governs nothing", an "undistributed annex kept for
     detail", or a `*_OLD` / `*_backup` copy is deleted, not retained "just in case". Recovering
     it is one `git show` away.
  2. **Scratch and one-off notes** — sprint notes, exported Notion/wiki pages, meeting dumps,
     session scratch. Ephemeral state lives in the tracker (Notion is the source of truth), never
     committed to the repo.
  3. **Stray assets** — diagrams, images or files unrelated to *this* repo's own product (a
     portfolio-wide diagram belongs in the portfolio repo, not a library).
  4. **Idea stubs for projects that live elsewhere** — a placeholder README for a future/other
     project is drift; the project gets its own repo when it starts.
  5. **Generated reports that are not a CI baseline** — an audit/report output is gitignored, not
     committed. Only a file diffed by CI as a drift baseline (e.g. `*.baseline`) is tracked.
  The test is mechanical: a file that governs nothing, is loaded by nothing, and is read by no
  current reader does not belong — delete it. When a deletion would leave dangling references,
  the references are repointed in the same change, never left broken. Checked in PR review; a
  file that fails the test is a defect, not clutter to tolerate.
- **Dockerfiles are multi-stage, with a `production` and a `dev` stage — mandatory.** Every
  application Dockerfile uses named build stages so a single file yields both runtime and
  developer images (`docker build --target production` / `--target dev`). Minimum stages:
  a shared `base` (interpreter + OS deps), a `builder`/`deps` (compiles/installs dependencies),
  a **`production`** target (slim runtime — no dev tooling, non-root `USER`, only the built
  artifact), and a **`dev`** target (production + test/lint/debug tooling, editable install,
  live-reload). A single-stage Dockerfile, or one missing either `production` or `dev`, is a
  defect. Compose services select the target explicitly (`build.target: production|dev|tests`).
  Canonical shape + Python 3.14 example: the `dockerfile-multistage` skill.
  *Exemption — container-collection repos:* a repo whose product **is** a set of standalone
  utility/tool container images (e.g. `usefull-containers`), not one application, is exempt from the
  `production`+`dev` two-stage rule per image — each image is single-purpose. Such images still must
  not embed a reverse proxy and still run as non-root where they bind-mount host paths.
- **App containers ship the app only — the platform layer is the owner's responsibility.** An
  application image/container **never embeds a reverse proxy** (nginx/Traefik/Caddy/HAProxy as a
  TLS-terminating or routing front). The app container exposes its own port and speaks plain HTTP;
  routing, TLS, virtual hosts, and load-balancing live in the **platform layer** (the owner's
  Nginx/Traefik + Certbot on the host, or `deploy/k8s/` ingress), out of the app image. A static
  frontend may use a minimal internal web server to serve its own built assets, but it does **not**
  proxy other services. Baking a reverse proxy into an app container is a defect (couples the app to
  infra, duplicates the platform, and breaks the ownership boundary).
- **Dev stage must hot-reload.** The `dev` target/service provides live auto-reload so a source edit
  is reflected without a manual rebuild/restart: backend `uvicorn --reload` (or the framework's
  autoreload), frontend the dev server with HMR (`vite`/`npm run dev`), watched via the compose
  `develop.watch` sync or a source bind mount. A `dev` image identical to `production` (no reload) is
  not a dev image. Mechanised by the `compose-dev-hot-reload` hook
  (`chrysa/pre-commit-tools`): a compose service targeting the `dev` stage with neither a bind
  mount nor a `develop.watch` sync action is flagged at commit time.
- **`.dockerignore` mandatory & exhaustive** — at minimum `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`,
  `.env*`, `*.log`. Base images pin an explicit version or digest (never a bare `FROM …:latest`);
  no secret in build args or image layers (BuildKit secrets or runtime env only). Every application
  Dockerfile declares a `HEALTHCHECK`, and compose services set `restart: unless-stopped`.
- **Setup wizard & config panel** (deployable web apps/services — not libs, CLIs, utilities). A
  first-run **setup wizard** (CLI or web) covers DB, admin user, integrations, secrets and locale;
  it is **idempotent**, detects missing prerequisites with explicit fixes, and offers a CI skip
  (`SETUP_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`). On missing/invalid config at startup or runtime, the app **redirects
  to `/setup`** rather than crashing or showing a generic error. An admin **configuration panel**
  (auth-gated CRUD API) manages runtime config with a versioned audit trail, hot-reload where
  possible (else a `RESTART_REQUIRED` flag), and JSON export/import for backup and cross-env cloning.
- **Raised errors are typed** — in any language whose type system allows it. Code raises a
  **domain-specific exception class** (Python: a module `…Error(Exception)` hierarchy rooted in one
  base per bounded context; TypeScript: `class XError extends Error` with a discriminant field, or a
  typed `Result`/`Either`; C#: a derived `Exception`). **Forbidden**: raising a bare `Exception`/
  `RuntimeError`/`Error`, `throw "string"`, `throw {code: …}` object literals, or signalling failure
  by a magic return value (`None`/`-1`/`false`) where an error type is expressible. Catch sites match
  the narrowest type (`except ValidationError`, never bare `except:`/`except Exception` outside a
  top-level boundary), and every error carries a stable machine-readable code plus a message that
  says what to do. The public error taxonomy of a module is part of its contract — documented and
  versioned like its signatures. Detail: the `error-handling` skill.
- **Failures are contained, and observable.** A *local* error must not become a *global* one: a
  failing dependency, task, or request is isolated so the rest of the system keeps serving.
  Beyond the type + stable `code`, an error carries the taxonomy fields it needs to be triaged —
  `category`, `severity`, `retryable`, `scope`, a `correlation_id` threading it across services,
  and both a user-facing and an operator-facing message. Every outbound call has an explicit
  **timeout** and **bounded retries** (never an unbounded retry loop); a repeatedly-failing
  dependency is fronted by a **circuit-breaker**, and independent workloads by a **bulkhead**, so
  one saturated path cannot drown the others. Errors are emitted to the shared observability
  backend (**Mirador** or a compatible one), correlation id included, not just written to a local
  log. A surface's Definition of Done includes its error paths, not only its happy path.
- **Prefer a lookup table to a state machine.** Branching on a value — dispatch, routing, parsing,
  handler/strategy selection, enum → behaviour, status → transition — is expressed as a **hash
  table** (`dict`/`Record`/`Map`) from key to handler or value, **not** as an `if/elif` ladder, a
  `switch`/`match` cascade, or a hand-rolled state machine with a `self._state` variable. The
  mapping is data: declared once, typed (`dict[Status, Handler]`), exhaustive over the key domain
  (checked by the type system or a test), and extended by adding a row — never by editing control
  flow. This keeps cyclomatic complexity flat and makes every branch independently testable. An
  explicit state machine is legitimate only when the transitions genuinely carry state-dependent
  semantics no table can express (concurrent protocol, long-running workflow, parser with a stack);
  choosing one is a documented decision, and even then transitions themselves live in a
  transition **table**, not in nested conditionals.
- **Decompose into small, independently unit-testable methods.** A function does one thing at one
  level of abstraction; anything with its own name, branch, or rule is extracted so it can be
  called and asserted **in isolation, without I/O, without mocks of the whole world**. Concretely:
  pure business rules are separated from orchestration and from I/O (compute in a pure function,
  side effects at the edges), so a test needs no DB/HTTP/filesystem to exercise the rule; a private
  helper that is hard to test in isolation is a signal the seam is in the wrong place, not a reason
  to skip the test. This is what makes the *max function lines 50* / *complexity ≤ 10* gates
  achievable rather than gamed, and it is the mechanism behind the coverage floor: coverage reached
  only through end-to-end paths, with untestable god-functions underneath, does not satisfy this rule.
- **Basic optimisations and known anti-patterns are caught in review and in CI.** Code is written
  correct-then-obvious first — **no speculative micro-optimisation**, no premature caching, no
  hand-tuned trick without a measurement (profile before optimising; `perf` claims come with
  numbers). But the *basic* wins are non-negotiable because they are algorithmic, not clever:
  1. **Right data structure** — membership test on a `set`/`Map` (O(1)), not a linear scan of a list;
     index/dict lookup instead of a nested loop (O(n²) over a joinable key is a defect);
     a single pass instead of repeated traversals of the same collection.
  2. **No work in a loop that is loop-invariant** — hoist the constant computation, the compiled
     regex, the config read, the connection setup.
  3. **No N+1** — database queries and network/API calls are batched or eager-loaded
     (`selectinload`/`joinedload`, bulk endpoints); a query inside a `for` over rows is a defect.
     Frontend equivalent: no request per list item, no re-render per keystroke without debounce,
     no unmemoised derived state recomputed on every render.
  4. **Bounded resources** — no unbounded `SELECT *` / unpaginated list endpoint, no full-file read
     of arbitrary-size input (stream it), explicit timeouts on every outbound call, connections and
     file handles closed via context managers.
  5. **Known anti-patterns are named and rejected**: god object/function, copy-paste duplication
     (factor into `chrysa-lib` — see *no code duplication*), boolean trap parameters, primitive
     obsession over a value object, deep nesting (guard clauses instead), mutable default arguments,
     shared mutable global state, silent `except: pass` (see *typed errors*), stringly-typed domains,
     circular imports, and dead code kept "just in case" (git is the archive).
  Mechanisation: Ruff (`C901`, `PLR*`, `B`, `SIM`, `PERF`, `RUF`) + Mypy on Python, ESLint
  (`complexity`, `no-await-in-loop`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`) on TS, SonarCloud rating **A**
  with 0 hotspot on both. A finding here is a defect to fix, not a warning to carry.

## Quality gates

- Test coverage **>= 85%** by default. A repo may override upward, never below 80%.
- Lint warnings: **0**. Mypy clean. SonarCloud rating **A**, 0 security hotspot.
- Max function lines 50 · max file lines 500 · cyclomatic complexity heuristic <= 10.

## Design system

Every human-facing surface is built from a shared design system — no ad-hoc style values in
components. This complements *dark mode + WCAG 2.1 AA* and the `ui-ux` skill.

- **Design tokens are the single source of style** — colours, typography, spacing, radii,
  shadows, z-index live as tokens (JSON/CSS vars) consumed by code. **No** hardcoded style
  literals in components (mirrors *no hardcoded constants*).
- **Versioned brand kit** — primary/secondary/semantic palette, **≤ 2 type families**, logo
  (variants + clear space), one icon set. Defined and versioned, not per-repo reinvented.
- **Living component library** — reusable components with documented states and variants
  (Storybook or equivalent); one canonical implementation per component.
- **Systematic spacing scale & grid** — spacing on a fixed scale (4/8 px base), shared grid
  and breakpoints; no arbitrary margins.
- **Defined type hierarchy** — explicit type scale (size, weight, line-height, tracking) with
  named roles (`display/title/body/caption`), never ad-hoc sizes.
- **Systematic interaction states & feedback** — every interactive element exposes
  hover/focus/active/disabled; every action gives visible feedback (< 100 ms); visible keyboard
  focus is mandatory.
- **Consistent UX writing** — voice-and-tone guide; error messages say what to do (no raw
  codes); action-oriented labels and CTAs; terminology aligned to the domain glossary.
- **Standardised motion** — tokenised durations and easing (e.g. 150/250 ms); animation is
  functional (state transition, feedback), never gratuitous; honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Mobile-first responsive** — mobile-first design, breakpoints from tokens, touch targets
  **≥ 44 px**, no fixed widths.
- **Design ↔ dev handoff contract** — design ships exported tokens, component specs (measures,
  states, behaviours) and edge cases; dev consumes the tokens, never redefines the values.

## Makefile targets

- **Referential**: `Forge-Stack-Workshop/base-makefile` (`Makefile.basic`, `Makefile.python`,
  `Makefile.with-sub-folder`) is the single source of truth for target names and behaviour.
- **Canonical naming** — follow base-makefile verbatim, one word where it is one word:
  `typecheck` (**never** `type-check`), `test-cov`, `format-check`, `quality-gate-verify`,
  `docker-test`, `ci`. Renaming or aliasing a canonical target is forbidden.
- **Mandatory socle** — every application repo MUST expose, with these exact names and intent:
  `help install install-dev lint format format-check typecheck test test-cov pre-commit clean
  ci quality-gate-baseline quality-gate-verify`. Non-applicative repos (pure infra/Helm/Terraform,
  config-only, docs) are exempt from the language-specific targets (`typecheck`, `test-cov`) but
  still expose `help lint pre-commit clean`.
- **Docs must match** — every `make <target>` cited in `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` MUST exist in
  the Makefile (no `make type-check` when the target is `typecheck`).
- **Recipe style** — prefix every recipe line with `@`; add `## Description` after each target so
  it appears in `make help`.

## Container-runtime policy

A project runs **only in a container** unless its nature genuinely forbids it. Convenience, "easier
on the host", or "it's just a script" are **not** exemptions — when in doubt, classify `container`.
Every repo carries a `runtime:` field in `repos.yml`, machine-checked by `audit-docker-compliance.sh`:

- `container` — runs as a service. Provides Dockerfile(s) + `docker-compose*` + `HEALTHCHECK` +
  `docker-up`/`docker-down`/`docker-test` targets.
- `exempt:lib` — distributed/imported (library, plugin, pre-commit hook, GitHub Action, CLI). Runs
  in the consumer's environment; provides a `docker-test` target (CI runs the suite in a container).
- `exempt:config` — no executable runtime (config, knowledge base, deploy manifests). Nothing to run.
- `exempt:native` — bound to a host OS, device, cloud platform, or editor (desktop integration,
  hardware, Apps Script, VS Code extension, infra/Helm). Optional `Dockerfile.test` for CI.
- `pending` — pre-code scaffold; flips to `container` at first code.

## Release & changelog config (canonical)

- **Versioning** is GitVersion (`GitVersion.yml`, flat `mode: ContinuousDeployment`) — never bump
  manually. Legacy v5 schemas (`GitHubFlow`, no top-level `mode:`) are incompatible and must be
  **replaced**, not version-bumped.
- **Changelog** is generated by git-cliff (`cliff.toml`), Keep a Changelog format.
- `GitVersion.yml` and `cliff.toml` are **canonical files** with a single source of truth in
  shared-standards (repo root + byte-identical `templates/` copy). A `repo: local` pre-commit hook
  (`gitversion-canonical-drift`, `cliff-canonical-drift`) blocks drift; `audit-canonical-conformance.sh`
  audits the fleet.
- **Docs** live in `docs/` (MkDocs), deployed to GitHub Pages via `pages.yml`. `README.md` reflects
  the actual current state and is updated on each release.
- **Registry** — application images publish to **private GHCR** (`ghcr.io/chrysa/{repo}`, tags mirror
  the git tag + `:latest`); CI authenticates with the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or least-privilege
  `packages:write`), never a plaintext PAT. Distributable libraries publish to public PyPI via
  Trusted Publishing (OIDC), never a token in plaintext.

## Pre-commit & git hooks (native, via pre-commit.com — never wrapped in make)

The enforcement engine is **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)** itself, configured
in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. pre-commit is the authoritative runner; `make lint` /
`make pre-commit` may exist as thin convenience aliases, but a hook that only runs
through `make` is a defect — every hook MUST be runnable via `pre-commit run` directly,
and CI invokes `pre-commit`, not `make`.

- **The gate is host-native — no strong coupling to the project's containers.** pre-commit
  runs with only `pre-commit` installed on the host (via `pipx`/`uv`, outside any repo); it
  provisions each hook's isolated environment itself (`~/.cache/pre-commit`), so a commit
  needs **no project image and no running container**. Local hooks are `language: system` /
  `python` (or another native language) invoking **host** tools — **never** `docker compose
  run`, and `language: docker` / `docker_image` is avoided. A check that genuinely needs the
  project image (Django settings, a DB, a compiled tool) **degrades gracefully on the host**:
  it probes for the tool and skips with a message when absent
  (`command -v <tool> >/dev/null 2>&1 && <run> || echo 'skipping — runs in CI/Docker'`),
  it does **not** spin up a container. Container-side enforcement is CI's job; locally the
  gate is best-effort and never blocks on the Docker daemon being up. This does not
  contradict the container-runtime policy — the *application* runs in a container; the
  *commit gate*, like git, is a host tool.
- **Two stages, two scopes — do not mix them:**
  - **commit stage** (`pre-commit run`, default): auto-fixers + fast lints —
    `ruff`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `trailing-whitespace`, `detect-secrets`/`gitleaks`,
    `conventional-pre-commit` (commit-msg), `no-commit-to-branch --branch main`.
    These **mutate** the tree, so they only ever run over the staged/committed diff.
  - **pre-push stage** (`pre-commit run --hook-stage pre-push`): only hooks tagged
    `stages: [pre-push]` (e.g. `regression-gate` from `chrysa/pre-commit-tools`), run
    **natively over the pushed commit range** (`--from-ref <remote>` `--to-ref <local>`).
    A push **verifies, it never mutates** the tree.
- **Forbidden at push time:** `make lint`, and `pre-commit run --all-files`. Running the
  full tree at push re-executes commit-stage **auto-fixers** on unrelated files, mutates
  them, exits non-zero, and **rejects the push over a pre-existing defect in a file you
  never touched**. `--all-files` belongs to CI (where a mutation surfaces as a diff) and
  to a deliberate local audit — never to the push gate.
- **The global pre-push hook** (`dotfiles/git-hooks-global/pre-push`) mirrors pre-commit's
  own installed pre-push hook: it runs the `pre-push` stage over the range only, then the
  SonarCloud quality gate. No `make`, no `--all-files`, no tree mutation.
- Hooks are **pinned by `rev`**; shared hooks come from `chrysa/pre-commit-tools`.
  `detect-secrets`/`gitleaks` respect the repo's secret allowlist.

## Error handling pattern (all automations)

```text
try:    fn()
except: gh issue create --title "[chrysa] failure" --label "chrysa-error"
```

## Observability — Sentry → GitHub issues (norm)

Every status:dev repo ships a Sentry project, and **a new Sentry issue automatically opens a
GitHub issue** via Sentry's native GitHub integration. No relay, no PAT in the repo — the
integration owns the link, so a Sentry issue maps to exactly one GitHub issue (no duplicates).

Mechanism: a per-project Sentry **issue alert rule** with
condition `FirstSeenEventCondition` (a new issue is created) and action
`GitHubCreateTicketAction` targeting `chrysa/<repo>`, labels `sentry`, `bug`.
Provision it across all projects with
`shared-standards/scripts/sentry-github-issues.sh` (idempotent, `--dry-run` first).

Per-project activation checklist:

1. Org GitHub integration installed once in Sentry (Settings → Integrations → GitHub) with
   access to the chrysa repos.
2. The repo has a Sentry project whose slug matches the repo name.
3. The auto-issue alert rule exists (run the provisioning script, or add it in
   Alerts → Create Alert → Issues → action "Create a GitHub issue").
4. The GitHub repo has a `sentry` label (CI label sync provides it).

## Session lifecycle (primer + memory + hindsight)

Every repo ships a session lifecycle so an AI agent keeps context across sessions. Bootstrap with
`make memory-init`; scripts live in `shared-standards/scripts/`.

- `primer.md` (committed) — current state, what to do NOW; read **before** `CLAUDE.md`.
- `.claude/memory/session.md` — volatile session notes, **not** committed (reset each session).
- `.claude/memory/decisions.md`, `known-issues.md`, `progress.md` (append-only history) — committed.
- **Session start**: `make prepare` (`/prepare`) — shows primer + git context + open PRs.
- **Session end**: `make hindsight` (`/hindsight`) — updates `primer.md` + `progress.md`, clears
  `session.md`, optional Obsidian export (`OBSIDIAN=<path>`).

## Governance — strategic pillars & ADR format

Five non-negotiables hold across every chrysa project, whatever the stack. Breaking one
requires an ADR with a kill-test, not a shrug.

1. **LLM-provider independence** — no vendor SDK in business code; inference goes through a
   local port with **≥2 real, tested adapters** (e.g. Claude + a local model). A prompt that
   only works on one vendor is a bug, not a feature.
2. **GAFAM independence** — every managed-cloud dependency has a documented self-hosted exit
   path; the cloud SDK stays confined to an adapter (`BlobStore`, not `S3Client`).
3. **Portable personalisation data** — all user/personal data is exportable to an open format
   (JSON/SQLite) by a documented command; `export → import → export` is idempotent (tested).
   A stored-but-unexportable field needs an ADR.
4. **k8s config in-project** — manifests live in `deploy/k8s/` of the repo; nothing exists
   only inside a running cluster.
5. **Adaptation layer** — no third-party lib/API/service is imported by the domain directly;
   it goes through an adapter whose port is written in the domain's language, not the vendor's.

**ADR format (refutable).** Any structural decision — new external dependency, LLM/cloud
provider choice, breaking public-API change, data-model change, or a pillar exception — gets
one ADR under `docs/adr/` (series named in the local `CLAUDE.md`). Beyond the classic fields,
every chrysa ADR carries three that make it falsifiable:

- **Fatal hypothesis** — the single, falsifiable belief whose falsity invalidates the decision.
  One only; about the real world (cost, latency, a third party), not an internal intention.
- **Kill-test** — the observable, dated signal that proves it wrong: what to measure, which
  threshold, when checked, what happens on breach. Mechanised as a test where possible.
- **Validation gate** — the pre-agreed condition that unlocks the next step, written *before*
  building.

`Killed` is a valid ADR status: the kill-test fired and the hypothesis was false. A corpus with
no `Killed` entry has kill-tests that are too lax. Scaffold a new record with `/adr-new`.
